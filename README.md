Data Structures and Algorithms Major Assignment

C++ Code Execution Guide

This project aims to explore various algorithms and problem-solving techniques in the field of Data Structures and Algorithms. 
It consists of 12 different problems implemented in C++, covering topics such as Greedy Algorithm, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and Divide and Conquer.

Problems
Problem 1 - Greedy Algorithm: This problem requires implementing a solution using a greedy approach.
Problem 2 - Greedy Algorithm: Similar to Problem 1, but with a different scenario or constraints.
Problem 3 - Dynamic Programming: Repeat of Problem 2, but this time using Dynamic Programming to solve it more efficiently.
Problem 4 - Greedy Algorithm: Another problem to be solved using a greedy approach.
Problem 5 - Dynamic Programming: Similar to Problem 4, but using Dynamic Programming instead.
Problem 6 - Backtracking: Implement a solution using the Backtracking technique.
Problem 7 - Backtracking: Another Backtracking problem, possibly with different constraints.
Problem 8 - Backtracking: Yet another Backtracking problem to solve.
Problem 9 - Backtracking: Another Backtracking problem, possibly more complex or with different constraints.
Problem 10 - Divide and Conquer: Implement a solution using the Divide and Conquer approach.
Problem 11 - Divide and Conquer: Another problem to be solved using Divide and Conquer.
Problem 12 - Divide and Conquer: A final problem in this category, possibly with a unique twist.
